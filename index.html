            Hello there and welcome to my 45rpm record collection. I used to be a bit of a record 
            collector, but about 4 years ago I went digital (which isn't quite the same as 
            Dylan going electric, but it was a big change). I subsequently sold off most of 
            my collection. Anyway, I was looking for an excuse to play around with some infographics 
            using only CSS (plus a few backgound images) so I chose what's left of my 7" singles. 
            
        <br />

            I have 198 records left, which are a mixture of Funk, Soul, RnB, Reggae, Jazz and Latin.
             I have displayed them using a variety of statistics which can be seen below.
            
        <br />

            For the record: This page has no semantic value, it's just a bit of fun, 
            done purely for my own enjoyment (and hopefully yours). Enjoy your stay.
